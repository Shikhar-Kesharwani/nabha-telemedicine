## 🚀 Cloud Deployment Architecture

This project is fully optimized for cloud deployment with 100% parity to the local development environment. It supports a dual-architecture deployment model:

### 1. Platform Native (PaaS)
Pre-configured for zero-downtime deployment on platforms like Render, Vercel, or Firebase.
- Native configuration files (e.g., ender.yaml) are included for one-click deployments.
- Environment variables prioritize cloud APIs (Groq, Gemini, OpenAI) to ensure compatibility with free-tier memory limits.

### 2. Dockerized Containers
For isolated, infrastructure-agnostic deployment on VPS or Cloud Run.
- **Multi-stage Dockerfile**: Optimized for lightweight, fast builds.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Configured with strict health checks, network isolation, and unless-stopped restart policies.
- Automatically handles local dependencies and avoids local OOM crashes by prioritizing cloud inference APIs.

### 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration and Deployment is handled via GitHub Actions.
- Workflows are configured in .github/workflows/ to automatically test and deploy changes pushed to the main branch.
